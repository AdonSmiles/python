# 7.0.1. Count Number of Divisor

Solution: 1
---------


```python
n = int(input())        # input() function takes input as string.int() converts this string to integer type.
i,count = 1,0

while i<=n:
    if n%i == 0:
        count = count + 1
    i = i+1

print("Total divisor of %d is %d"%(n,count))

```

    18
    Total divisor of 18 is 6
    

Soltution: 2
---------


```python
n = int(input())
i,count = 1,0

for i in range(1,n+1):
    if n%i==0:
        count+=1

print("Total divisor of {} is {}".format(n,count))

```

    24
    Total divisor of 24 is 8
    

Solution: 3
---------



```python
n = int(input())
i,count = 1,0

while i*i<=n:               # as a*b = n, so divisor of part 'a' can not be bigger than n/b. If any 'a' divides 'n' then there is another divisor n/a = b
    if(n%i==0):
        if n/i!=i:            # for example a square number like 16. If i = 2 then 16/2 = 8 and there is two uniqe divisor but if i = 4 then 16/4 = 4. In this case only one divisor will be counted.
            count+=1;
        count+=1
    i+=1

print("Total divisor of {} is {}".format(n,count))

```

    16
    Total divisor of 16 is 5
